		<h3 style="margin-left:100px">Tiramisu</h3>
		<img src="https://github.com/E2245373/E2245373.github.io/blob/main/Images/tiramisu.jpeg" style="margin-left:100px; float:left" alt="Picture of Tiramisu">
		<p>Tiramisu is a decadent and iconic Italian dessert renowned for its rich flavors, creamy texture, and delightful combination of ingredients. This beloved dessert has gained popularity worldwide and is cherished for its indulgent taste and elegant presentation.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The dessert is traditionally made by layering ingredients such as ladyfinger biscuits (savoiardi) that are soaked in espresso coffee or coffee liqueur. These soaked biscuits form the base of the dessert and provide a soft, moist layer. A luscious mixture of mascarpone cheese, eggs, and sugar is then layered over the ladyfingers. This creamy and velvety layer is often flavored with a hint of vanilla extract and sometimes combined with a splash of Marsala wine or other liqueurs, adding depth to the dessert's taste. Tiramisu is typically dusted with cocoa powder or grated chocolate on top, enhancing both the visual appeal and the overall taste of the dish. The contrast between the light, creamy mascarpone layer and the coffee-soaked biscuits creates a harmonious blend of flavors that is both rich and satisfying.</p>
		<h3 style="margin-left:100px; margin-top:3%">Gelato</h3>
		<img src="https://github.com/E2245373/E2245373.github.io/blob/main/Images/gelato.jpeg" style="margin-left:100px; float:left" alt="Picture of Gelato">
		<p>Gelato is a luxurious and beloved frozen dessert originating from Italy, celebrated for its smooth, creamy texture and intense flavors. It is often compared to ice cream, but gelato distinguishes itself through its unique ingredients, production process, and overall composition. The production process involves churning the gelato at a slower speed than ice cream, resulting in less air being introduced, giving gelato its denser consistency. This slower churning process contributes to its silkier texture and intense taste.</p>
		<br>
		<p>What sets gelato apart from traditional ice cream is its lower fat content, less air incorporation, and typically served at a slightly warmer temperature. Gelato is made using a base of milk, sugar, and sometimes cream, combined with various fresh fruits, nuts, chocolates, or other flavorings. It contains less butterfat than ice cream, resulting in a smoother and denser texture that allows the flavors to stand out more vividly.</p>
